    <!-- Continue from 6D , lets say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. create a variable :
     const isHoliday=true;
     1.update the code so that in order to get a discount , people must meet the age requieremnt and it also not a 
     holiday.
     && has Higher priority than || so control which runs first with a () , Change isHoliday vaue to display different messages. -->
